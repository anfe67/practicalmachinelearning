# practicalmachinelearning

This is my project repository, with all project files. The rmd file is index.Rmd, the html is index.html. The repository is organized as a gh-pages, 
so there is an automatically linked page at https://anfe67.github.io/practicalmachinelearning. For ease of review you can point your browsers to that address. 
All plots are included when you see it from there.
